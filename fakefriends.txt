I saw you fakes on my live, no surprise,
Claiming you real but it's all just lies.
Fronting with smiles, but deep down you fake,
Tryna ride my wave, but I saw that mistake.

Fake friends, no respect, they be on that shady play,
Holla louder when they need somethin', then quickly fade away.
But I see through your charades, no time for y'all in my life,
I won't fall for the tricks, 'cause only real ones thrive.

Respect ain't a game, it's how you hold it down,
True friends stay real, they never make you frown.
We dont got no space for them snakes on my team,
recognize is real, it's a feeling supreme.
